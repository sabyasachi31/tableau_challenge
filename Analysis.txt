The data used in the analysis is the NY CITI BIKE data from the year 2019 for the months May-October. 
Therefore, the analysis is for the summer months, including the early fall and late spring months.

From the data, some unexpected phenomenon that were uncovered are: 
1. There are a lot less female riders using the program than male. 
Although this number grows from May to September, it plummets again in October. 
This might be due to end of summer or some other reason that needs to be looked into.

2. From the map and from other analyses it is clear that most trips occur between few selected stations, mostly in Manhattan.
The top 10 stations for pickup and drop-off are the same set of stations. 
Therefore, plans must be formulated to increase ridership in other lesser used stations.

3. There are a lot more trips by long term subscribers than short term customers. 

4.  The most common age of riders is either around 30 or 50.

5. Most rides are booked during office start time (8:00 A.M.) and end time (5:00 P.M.). 
However, these trips are short in duration
This suggests that people generally use these bikes for travelling to/from offices and public transportation stations.

6. The busiest days of the week are Wednesday and Friday. The busiest month is September.
